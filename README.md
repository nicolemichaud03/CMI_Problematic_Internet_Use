# Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Usage (Kaggle Competition)

## Business Problem

The goal of this project is to use physical activity and fitness data to determine the likelihood that children and adolescents will exhibit problematic internet usage.
In this instance, problematic internet usage can be defined as, "the use of the Internet that creates psychological, social, school and/or work difficulties in a person's life" (Beard and Wolf, 2001).

The desired outcome of achieving the goals of this project is that the findings could then be used to improve treatments, interventions, and general awareness when it comes to mental and physical health and wellbeing.

The data provided for this project reflects the realities of many real-world datasets: it is very sparse with lots of values missing for certain rows.
The target variable, 'sii' (Severity Impairment Index) is missing for a large portion of the training data.
My strategy to deal with this is to utilized semi-supervised learning modeling techniques, where the model learns from the non-null target values to then predict the missing values and be used to generate a final prediction on the unseen data.
